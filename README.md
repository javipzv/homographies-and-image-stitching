# Homographies and Image Stitching

## Homography-Based Planar Object Detection

This exercise implements a system for localizing a planar textured object in an image. The camera resection from the estimated homography is then utilized to seamlessly insert another image with the correct perspective into the original scene.

### Results
- Sample images showcasing planar object detection.
- Computational time measurements for various configurations.

## Image Stitching for Panorama Creation

This section focuses on stitching five horizontally overlapping photographs into a single panoramic image. The process involves recovering transformation parameters between each pair of images, warping the images to align them, and creating an image mosaic.

## Wide Panorama with 7 Images

Expanding on the panorama creation, this part introduces the challenge of joining seven images to create a wide panorama without distortion near the edges. Instead of projecting the mosaic on a plane, alternative surfaces like a sphere or cylinder are explored to mitigate unwanted distortions.
